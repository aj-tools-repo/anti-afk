# anti-afk

Introducing a Python library **anti-afk**, designed to simulate user activity, ensuring that your system remains active and does not enter an idle state (AFK). The library periodically moves the mouse pointer and can optionally simulate a key press (defaulting to the Shift key). This functionality delivers several professional benefits:

**Enhanced Session Stability:**
Prevents unwanted session terminations in environments such as VPN connections, remote desktop sessions, and remote debugging, thereby reducing the risk of losing unsaved work.

**Operational Continuity:**
Maintains active sessions across various remote and cloud-based platforms, ensuring that time-sensitive workflows are not disrupted by automatic timeouts or logouts.

**Improved Multi-Tasking Efficiency:**
Supports scenarios where multiple customer sessions or tasks are managed concurrently, enabling uninterrupted work streams and more efficient resource allocation.

By keeping your systemâ€™s status active, this library helps safeguard against connectivity disruptions and session timeouts, contributing to a more resilient and productive operational environment.

## Features

- **Simulated Mouse Movement:** Randomly moves the mouse within a specified pixel range.
- **Optional Key Press Simulation:** Simulates a Shift key press to generate extra activity.
- **Customizable Duration & Interval:** Specify how long and how frequently the simulation should run.
- **Interruptible Execution:** The simulation stops immediately if the ESC key is pressed.

## Installation

You can install **anti-afk** from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install anti-afk-lib
```

## Example

Below is the simple example to call the module for 10 minutes (run_duration: Run for 10 minutes).

```bash
from anti_afk.anti_afk import AntiAFK
AntiAFK(run_duration=10).run()
```

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following Python packages:

- [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)
- [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)

You can install these dependencies using pip. If you have a virtual environment set up, activate it first, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
